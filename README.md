# Connect4
Welcome to the MinMax algorithm for Connect4 <br /><br />
You can know about Connect4 at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Connect-Four.html <br />
Its maximum workable depth is 7; when it comes to be greater than 7, I haven't tested how many days it would take for next step lol <br />
The algorithm is based on MinMax, which finds the scores for each possible step (1st~7th column in this case) <br />
The winning rate of this algorithm is nearly 92%, compared to the best strategy (with depth = 9) <br />
I got first ranking with this in the tournament of best_move functions in my ECE 15 course. <br />
The result is here (don't actually know when the link will be down): http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~jiz114/ece15_fa18_tournament/?C=M;O=D <br />
My code is ee15flp and the first one is written by TA. Yes, the best strategy.
