# Connect 4
Minimax algorithm developed for [Connect4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

You can play around with Connect4 [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Connect-Four.html)

My algorithm's maximum workable depth is 7 due to the computation limit.
The algorithm is based on Minimax, which finds the scores for each possible step (1st~7th column in this game)
The winning rate of this algorithm is nearly 93%, compared to the best strategy (with depth = 9)
I got first ranking with this in the tournament of best_move functions in my Intro to C Programming course.

The result can be seen [here](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~jiz114/ece15_fa18_tournament/final_result.html) (My competition ID is ee15flp).
